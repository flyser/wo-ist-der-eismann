Wo ist der Eismann?
===================

A KDE plasmoid, which displays the current location of "Eis-Wagner" in Ilmenau, Germany.

State of the project
====================

I don't live in Ilmenau, so I have little motivation in improving this any
further. I mainly put it on github for other people to fork the code easily
and modify it for their needs.

You can try to send me pull requests, but I can not promise that I will
review and merge them.
